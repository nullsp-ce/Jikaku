# Jikaku

Jikaku is a Japanese Anki deck designed to quickly build kanji reading proficiency. Each card introduces a new kanji or kanji reading. The intent is that learning all the words in this deck will make it much easier to learn other words through reading alone without having to mine them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This deck assumes that you know everything in [Kaishi 1.5k](https://github.com/donkuri/Kaishi/tree/main). If you are a beginner, please complete Kaishi first.

> [!WARNING]
> Jikaku was generated using Python scripts, with errors such as wrong furigana or redundant words fixed manually. There may still be some errors remaining - please report any that you find.

## Stats
- 3000 kanji covered if combined with Kaishi, 2955 if standalone
